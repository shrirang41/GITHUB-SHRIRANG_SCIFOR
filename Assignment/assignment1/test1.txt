6.Diff between HTML vs XHTML?
ANS: 
1. Syntax
HTML: More lenient with syntax. For example, unclosed tags and case-insensitive tags are allowed (e.g., <BR> and <br> are both valid).
XHTML: Stricter syntax rules as it follows XML guidelines. Tags must be properly closed, all elements must be lowercase, 
and attribute values must be enclosed in quotes. For example, <br /> instead of <br>.
2. Language Basis
HTML: Based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), which allows for more flexibility.
XHTML: Based on XML (Extensible Markup Language), which is stricter and more predictable for machines to parse.
3. Case Sensitivity
HTML: Tag names are not case-sensitive, so <BODY> and <body> are treated the same.
XHTML: All tag and attribute names must be in lowercase.
4. Closing Tags
HTML: Some elements (like <img>, <br>, <hr>) don’t require closing tags.
XHTML: All elements, even empty ones like <img /> or <br />, must have a closing tag.
5. Error Handling
HTML: Browsers try to render pages even with syntax errors, often "guessing" what the developer intended.
XHTML: Browsers are less forgiving. A syntax error can cause the entire page to fail to render.
6. Compatibility
HTML: More forgiving, compatible with older browsers.
XHTML: Stricter, ensuring better interoperability between browsers and other XML-based systems.
7. MIME Type
HTML: Typically served as text/html.
XHTML: Should be served as application/xhtml+xml for true XHTML parsing, although it’s often served as text/html for compatibility with older browsers.
